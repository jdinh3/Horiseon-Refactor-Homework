# Refactor-Homework

## Description

This is the Horiseon website. The client wanted a codebase that follows accessibility standards to optimize its search engine results. I added semantic HTML elements, consolidated classes, added alt attributes to the images, and re-structured the stylesheet. I included comments to organize the sections of the webpage.
